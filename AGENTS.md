# Development Rules

## Conversational Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")
- Technical prose only, be direct
- When the user asks a question, answer it first before making edits or running implementation commands.
- When responding to user feedback or an analysis, explicitly say whether you agree or disagree before saying what you changed.

## Code Quality

- Read files in full before wide-ranging changes, before editing files you have not fully inspected, and when asked to investigate or audit. Do not rely on search snippets for broad changes.
- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Inline single-line helpers that have only one call site.
- Check node_modules for external API types; don't guess.
- **No inline imports** (`await import()`, `import("pkg").Type`, dynamic type imports). Top-level imports only.
- Never remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated deps; upgrade the dep instead.
- Use only erasable TypeScript syntax (Node strip-only mode) in code checked by the root config (`packages/*/src`, `packages/*/test`): no parameter properties, `enum`, `namespace`/`module`, `import =`, `export =`, or other constructs needing JS emit. Use explicit fields with constructor assignments.
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears intentional.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless the user asks for it.
- Never hardcode key checks (e.g. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`). Add defaults to `DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS` so they stay configurable.
- The pi model catalog is frozen and committed (see Vendored pi). The networked generators are gone; `npm run build -w packages/ai` is offline and validates the committed catalog through `check:model-data`.

## Commands

- After code changes (not docs): `npm run check` (full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing. Does not run tests.
- Never run `npm run build` or `npm test` unless requested by the user.
- Never run the full vitest suite directly: it includes e2e tests that activate when endpoint/auth env vars are present. For all non-e2e tests, run `./test.sh` from the repo root (it takes no arguments: it runs `npm test` under `env -i` and passes through only an explicit allowlist, being `PATH`, `PWD`, a throwaway `HOME` and temp directory, locale and timezone, neutralised git and npm configuration, `PI_NO_LOCAL_LLM=1`, the Windows variables needed to spawn processes, and CI detection; credentials are not on the list). Otherwise run specific tests from the package root: `npx vitest --run test/specific.test.ts` (vitest is hoisted to the repo root, not installed per-package; `node ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run <file>` works too).
- If you create or modify a test file, run it and iterate on test or implementation until it passes.
- For `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/`, use `test/suite/harness.ts` + the faux provider. No real provider APIs, keys, or paid tokens.
- Put issue-specific regressions under `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/` named `<issue-number>-<short-slug>.test.ts`.
- For ad-hoc scripts, `write` them to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp`), run, edit if needed, remove when done. Don't embed multi-line scripts in `bash` commands.
- Never commit unless the user asks.

## Dependency and Install Security

- Treat npm dep and lockfile changes as reviewed code. Direct external deps stay pinned to exact versions.
- Hydrate/update locally with `npm install --ignore-scripts`; clean/CI-style with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. Don't run lifecycle scripts unless the user asks.
- If dep metadata changes, refresh `package-lock.json` with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`.
- Pre-commit blocks lockfile commits unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1`. Don't bypass unless the user wants the lockfile change committed.

## Git

Multiple pi sessions may be running in this cwd at the same time, each modifying different files. Git operations that touch unstaged, staged, or untracked files outside your own changes will stomp on other sessions' work. Follow these rules:

Committing:

- Only commit files YOU changed in THIS session.
- Stage explicit paths (`git add <path1> <path2>`); never `git add -A` / `git add .`.
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging your files.
- Message format: `{feat,fix,docs}[(ai,tui,agent,coding-agent)]: <commit message> (optionally multiple lines)`. Message is informative and concise.

Never run (destroys other agents' work or bypasses checks):

- `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash`, `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit --no-verify`.

If rebase conflicts occur:

- Resolve conflicts only in files you modified.
- If a conflict is in a file you did not modify, abort and ask the user.
- Never force push.

## Issues and PRs

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contributor gate (auto-close workflows, `lgtm`/`lgtmi`, quality bar).

When reviewing PRs:

- Do not run `gh pr checkout`, `git switch`, or otherwise move the worktree to the PR branch unless the user explicitly asks.
- Use `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh api`, and local `git show`/`git diff` against fetched refs to inspect PR metadata, commits, and patches without changing branches.
- If you need PR file contents, fetch/read them into temporary files or use `git show <ref>:<path>` without switching branches.

When creating issues:

- Add `pkg:*` labels for affected packages (`pkg:agent`, `pkg:ai`, `pkg:coding-agent`, `pkg:tui`); use all that apply.

When posting issue/PR comments:

- Write the comment to a temp file and post with `gh issue/pr comment --body-file` (never multi-line markdown via `--body`).
- Keep comments concise, technical, in the user's tone.
- End every AI-posted comment with the AI-generated disclaimer line specified by the originating prompt (e.g. `This comment is AI-generated by `/wr``).

When closing issues via commit:

- Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the message so merging auto-closes the issue. For multiple issues, repeat the keyword per issue (`closes #1, closes #2`); a shared keyword (`closes #1, #2`) only closes the first.

## Testing pi Interactive Mode with tmux

Run the TUI in a controlled terminal (from the repo root):

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s pi-test -x 80 -y 24
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "./pi-test.sh" Enter
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t pi-test -p     # capture after startup
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "your prompt here" Enter
tmux send-keys -t pi-test Escape               # special keys (also C-o for ctrl+o, etc.)
tmux kill-session -t pi-test
```

## Vendored pi

`packages/coding-agent` and `packages/ai` are a vendored copy of pi 0.85.1 and stay there. This fork does not follow pi releases and does not keep its patches mergeable back into pi: edit the vendored code directly, like any other code in this repository. `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`, `@earendil-works/chord`, and `@earendil-works/pi-telemetry` are npm dependencies pinned to exactly `0.85.1` and are not bumped. The vendored copy no longer carries `packages/agent` or `packages/tui`, which are the first two of those, nor `packages/orchestrator`, which has no counterpart, nor pi's experimental remote runtime. chord and pi-telemetry are new 0.85.1 dependencies, not replacements.

The model catalog is frozen with it. `packages/ai/src/providers/data/` is committed, together with the provider catalog modules built from it. The JSON is the catalog published inside `@earendil-works/pi-ai@0.85.1`, generated 2026-09-05. Build pi-ai with `npm run build:offline`, which validates the committed catalog through `check:model-data` without network access.

Our pi is pi 0.85.1 plus the patches below. This list is the record; keep it current when you patch vendored pi.

`packages/coding-agent`:

- The SURE control plane under `src/core/sure/` and its suites (see SURE Harness).
- `ToolDefinition.activeByDefault`, so SURE's two run-control tools stay out of the default tool table.
- `noOpUIContext`, `notify` in print mode, and exit code 130 on SIGINT.
- `sendUserMessage` returns `Promise<void>`.
- Default extension injection: `src/core/default-extensions.ts` and its `InlineExtension` entries, suppressed by `--no-extensions`.
- A three-tier provider scope (`provider | all | scoped`) in the model selector.
- The `./hooks` package export (`dist/core/sure/hook-types.js`).
- The `/sure_init` compat note in `docs/models.md`.
- Azure default model `gpt-5.5`.
- A `ModelRegistry.login()` facade over the SURE auth adapter `src/core/sure/auth.ts`.
- SURE run settlement on `agent_settled` instead of `agent_end` / `willRetry`.
- `callContextHandlerAbortable` in `src/core/extensions/runner.ts`, so `context` event handlers abort with `ctx.signal` instead of running to completion after a cancelled run.

`packages/ai`:

- Dropped the dead `|| "Unknown error"` short-circuit in the Responses error template.
- `error-body.ts` reads a three-digit numeric-string `code` as a status and exposes bodies that carry no status.
- Responses `cancelled` and `failed` carry `errorMessage: "Response <status>"`.
- The Anthropic and OpenAI Codex OAuth callback servers time out after five minutes (`LOGIN_TIMEOUT_MS`), matching openrouter.
- A `PROVIDER_MIDSTREAM_ERROR` diagnostic on `openai-responses` and `azure-openai-responses` streams that drop after a 200, retryable in `retry.ts`, plus `isTerminalRateLimitError` de-duplication and a retry on "produced invalid content".

What the 0.85.1 move changed for users and maintainers is written up in `docs/pi-0.85.1-upgrade.md`.

### Removed from pi

Upstream features this fork no longer carries:

- The easter eggs `/arminsayshi` and `/dementedelves`.
- `/share`.
- Mermaid rendering.
- The bun single-file binary build (`npm run build:binary`).
- Changelog display (`/changelog`) and the startup version check.
- `pi update --self` and installer-managed installs.
- Install telemetry and provider attribution headers.
- The first-time setup wizard and its analytics settings.
- `PI_EXPERIMENTAL`.
- The pi.dev model catalog overlay.
- The llama.cpp extension.
- The pre-0.80 migrations and deprecation warnings.
- The `fd` and `ripgrep` auto-download; pi now uses `~/.pi/agent/bin` or PATH.
- The `examples/` directory of sample extensions and SDK snippets.
- RPC mode (`--mode rpc`, `rpc-entry`, `RpcClient`).
- HTML export (`--export`, HTML `/export`, the theme `export` colors).
- The pi-ai image generation stack (`generateImages`, `ImagesModels`, the OpenRouter images provider and its catalog).
- The networked model catalog generators (`scripts/generate-models.ts` and the two reasoning-options helpers); `npm run build -w packages/ai` is offline now.
- The second CLI (`bin: pi-ai`) and the bun OAuth flow registration.
- Bun compiled-binary detection (`isBunBinary`).
- The browser smoke check (`npm run check:browser-smoke`).
- The `canvas` devDependency and `scripts/generate-test-image.ts`.
- The `opencode` and `opencode-go` providers (OpenCode Zen and OpenCode Go).
- The `mistral` provider and its `mistral-conversations` API; Mistral models stay reachable through OpenRouter, the Vercel AI Gateway, NVIDIA, Cloudflare Workers AI, or a custom OpenAI-compatible gateway.
- The `google` and `google-vertex` providers, their `google-generative-ai` / `google-shared` / `google-vertex` APIs, and `@google/genai`; Gemini models stay reachable through GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter, the Vercel AI Gateway, or a custom OpenAI-compatible gateway.
- The `amazon-bedrock` provider, its `bedrock-converse-stream` API, and the AWS SDK; Bedrock-hosted models such as Amazon Nova stay reachable through OpenRouter or the Vercel AI Gateway.

## SURE Harness

This fork adds the SURE evaluation control plane: six skill commands (`/sure_feed`, `/sure_onboard`, `/sure_trans`, `/sure_approve`, `/sure_infer`, `/sure_eval`) plus the built-in `/sure_init` and `/sure_resume` commands. The common user entry point is `README.md`; bundled company distributions also carry `private/site/docs/handbook.md`. This section is the maintainer side.

### Skill Package Layout

```text
sure/skills/<skill-name>/
  sure.skill.json   # skill manifest
  SKILL.md          # agent-facing operating manual
  hooks/            # state-machine gates
  scripts/          # deterministic execution
  schemas/          # artifact contracts
  references/       # domain references
  examples/         # usage examples
```

Shared memory code lives outside the skill packages, next to the harness runtime:

```text
sure/runtime/memory/      # digest, gates, publish, index, cli (python, stdlib only) + match.ts / hooks.ts
sure/memory/              # instance data, git-ignored, group-writable in a shared checkout
```

### Targeted Checks

After code changes affecting SURE workflows, follow
`docs/asr-vad-coding-review.md` and complete the required Feed → Onboard →
Approve → Infer → Eval evidence chain. Use `npm run check` as an auxiliary
automated check; it does not replace the agent's workflow review. Missing
prediction, provenance or evaluation evidence means the review is incomplete.
Real-model acceptance is required when wrappers, audio preprocessing,
normalization, thresholds or runtime dependencies change.

```bash
npm run check:sure-hooks
python3 -m py_compile sure/skills/sure_infer/scripts/*.py
cd sure/skills/sure_onboard/scripts && python3 -m unittest test_runtime_inventory.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s sure/runtime/memory -p "test_*.py"
```

- `test_runtime_inventory.py` imports its siblings without touching `sys.path`, so it only runs from inside that directory.
- `python3 -m unittest sure/skills/sure_infer/scripts/test_protocol_provenance.py` needs an interpreter that has the harness-runtime dependencies (see `sure/runtime/harness/requirements.in`, which pins pydantic). The root `requirements.txt` is PyYAML-only and is not enough: on a bare interpreter this test fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'`. Skills at runtime use the locked venv that `sure/runtime/harness/bootstrap.py` materializes, not the system Python.
- Run `npm run sure:doctor` after changes that affect setup, skill discovery, or external engine detection.
- `npm run check` covers repo checks only and never runs tests; it is non-mutating, so use `npm run format` when Biome should rewrite files.

SURE test files live in `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/` (`sure-extension`, `sure-feed`, `sure-onboard-state-machine`, `sure-onboard-terminal`, `sure-infer-state-machine`, `sure-eval-runbackend`, `sure-eval-red-lines`, `sure-eval-terminal`, `sure-run-output-dir`, `sure-runtime-binding`, `sure-skill-output-dir`, `sure-memory-match`, `sure-memory-hooks`) plus the init suites under `packages/coding-agent/test/sure/`. Run them from `packages/coding-agent` per the vitest rule in Commands.

### Credential-Free Launchers

`test.sh` starts the suite from an empty environment with `env -i` and passes through only an allowlist of platform and test variables, so no credential in your shell reaches a test. `pi-test.sh --no-env` and `pi-test.ps1 --no-env` temporarily move `auth.json` out of the agent config directory for that run and restore it on exit; `test.sh` takes no flags.

### Runtime Provenance Lifecycle

| Stage | Artifact | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/sure_onboard` | `runtime_inventory.json` | Summarize model-level backend, Python, runtime probe, weights manifest, and small evidence links. Do not link checkpoint payloads. |
| `/sure_infer` | `prediction_generation_status.json` | Record the actual MCP server command, working directory, safe env snapshot, explicit tool args, protocol resolver output, and dataset generation status. |
| `/sure_infer` | `protocol.yaml` | Read generation status first, runtime inventory second, model config third, environment fallback last. Keep inference fields separate from evaluation results. |
| `/sure_eval` | `prediction_reuse_manifest.json` | Copy/filter predictions only; do not reuse old metric artifacts. |
| `/sure_eval` | `source_inference_provenance.json` | Link source protocol/status/runtime inventory when available and mark unknown sources explicitly. |

### Design Boundary

| Harness owns | Skill packages own |
| --- | --- |
| Slash-command discovery, run lifecycle, state persistence. | Domain prompts, deterministic scripts. |
| Hook execution, tool gates, final manifest validation. | State machines, schemas, checkpoints. |
| Shared runtime contracts. | Validation rules and repair instructions. |

Do not move task-specific metrics, dataset assumptions, or SURE business logic into the common harness unless the rule is truly shared by every skill.

### Repository Hygiene

Generated paths kept out of Git include:

```gitignore
/.sure/
/data/
/results/
/results_*/
/sure/results/
/sure/skills/sure_infer/results/
/sure/.runtime/
/sure/handoffs/
/sure/memory/
/sure/models/*
```

Never commit API keys, provider tokens, auth files, model weights, checkpoints, large datasets, prediction dumps, metric result dumps, virtual environments, or cache directories.

`sure/external/sure-evaluation` is a Git submodule. When bumping the verified engine, commit the gitlink together with the refreshed `sure/runtime/evaluation/runtime.json` lock (`engine_commit` and `engine_pyproject_sha256`). A gitlink-only commit makes the next `/sure_eval` fail on the locked-runtime check. Full procedure and the submodule contract: `docs/evaluation_engine.md`.

### Public Export

`npm run public:export` requires a clean worktree and projects only files tracked by the current Git index. `public-export.yaml` defines the public exclusions and generic deny rules; the optional `private/site/public-export.overlay.yaml` may only add private deny rules and is itself excluded. The v2 manifest identifies the projected tree without exposing the source commit. Use `--private-attestation-output` with an absolute path outside the repository when a private source-commit mapping is required. New private content must live under `private/`. The exclusion list is closed: `check:site-boundary` fails if `public-export.yaml` gains an entry outside the approved exception set.

### Handbook Copies

When the private company distribution is present, `private/site/docs/handbook.md` is the single source and `private/site/scripts/build-handbook.py` produces the markdown/HTML/PDF copies. It refuses to build from a dirty source unless `--dev` is passed, and dev builds are stamped `dev-*` so they cannot be mistaken for a release copy. See the maintenance note at the end of the private handbook.

## User Override

If the user's instructions conflict with any rule in this document, ask for explicit confirmation before overriding. Only then execute their instructions.
