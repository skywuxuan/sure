# SURE Harness

SURE Harness is an agent-based, system-level harness for reproducible model onboarding and evaluation. Built on the pi agent framework, it provides a TUI workflow that coding agents such as Codex, DeepSeek, and Kimi Code can operate through structured slash commands.

SURE turns model deployment, environment adaptation, inference-code generation, and dataset evaluation into one auditable workflow. The resulting runtime identity, dependency locks, parameters, model binding, predictions, metric route, and reports remain available as structured evidence, so an experiment is easier to reproduce, compare, and trust than an undocumented sequence of shell commands.

## Distribution

This repository supports two distributions from one codebase:

- A distribution with `config/site.bundled.yaml` carries a trusted site policy. Users do not create a local policy before running SURE workflows.
- A public or self-hosted distribution carries no operator policy, no approved models, and no datasets. It falls back to the zero-configuration default at `config/site.default.yaml`, which keeps every root under `~/.sure`. Users write their own storage and execution boundaries into `config/site.local.yaml` when those defaults do not fit.

The public core, command parameters, state machines, gates, runtime locks, artifact schemas, and evaluation configuration precedence are the same in both distributions. A site policy supplies deployment-specific roots and execution resources; it does not redefine workflow behavior.

Provider credentials and site policy are separate:

- `/sure_init` configures model providers and authentication.
- The site policy configures approved storage roots, forbidden output roots, dataset roots, a declared site runtime cache root, execution surfaces, and optional container delivery naming.

The locked Harness and Evaluation runtimes remain repository-local. A sealed local Model Python runtime is content-addressed below `storage.runtime_root`; its portable identity is stored with the model bundle and resolved against the active site at inference time.

## Quick Start

Node.js 22.19 or newer (see `.nvmrc`), Git, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and the repository submodules are required. On Windows also install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win): the agent's `bash` tool and the skills' `.sh` templates run through it. You do not need a system Python: uv fetches and pins the interpreters the runtimes need.

Install uv on Linux or macOS:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Install uv on Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The Harness and Evaluation runtimes are uv virtual environments that uv builds on first use. The first `/sure_*` command therefore needs network access and takes a few minutes while uv downloads its CPython 3.11 interpreter and installs the locked dependencies.

### Bundled site policy

Use this path when the distribution contains `config/site.bundled.yaml`:

```bash
# Linux, macOS, or Git Bash on Windows
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url> sure-harness
cd sure-harness
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run sure:site-info
npm run sure:site-check
npm run sure:doctor
PI_OFFLINE=1 ./pi-test.sh
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url> sure-harness
cd sure-harness
npm.cmd install --ignore-scripts
npm.cmd run sure:site-info
npm.cmd run sure:site-check
npm.cmd run sure:doctor
$env:PI_OFFLINE = "1"; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pi-test.ps1
```

```bat
:: Windows cmd.exe
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url> sure-harness
cd sure-harness
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run sure:site-info
npm run sure:site-check
npm run sure:doctor
set PI_OFFLINE=1
.\pi-test.bat
```

The PowerShell blocks call `npm.cmd` and forward the launcher through `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File` because Windows refuses to run `.ps1` files, npm's own `npm.ps1` included, under its default execution policy.

`sure:site-info` reports which policy is active; in a bundled distribution it must name the bundled source rather than the shipped default. Do not copy the public example over the bundled policy. A bundled distribution may include site-specific operating documentation below `private/`.

### Public/self-hosted site policy

The public distribution contains no private storage paths, internal gateways, cluster defaults, or credentials. `/sure_infer` and `/sure_eval` need an approved model rather than a configured deployment: a fresh machine starts with an empty approved root, and both commands refuse until `/sure_onboard` and `/sure_approve` have published a model into it. Configure the deployment when the default roots do not fit, or to point at approved storage that already exists:

```bash
# Linux, macOS, or Git Bash on Windows
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch harness-tui-agent https://github.com/PigeonDan1/sure.git sure-harness
cd sure-harness
npm install --ignore-scripts
cp config/site.example.yaml config/site.local.yaml
# Edit every path and execution surface in config/site.local.yaml.
npm run sure:site-check
npm run sure:doctor
PI_OFFLINE=1 ./pi-test.sh
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch harness-tui-agent https://github.com/PigeonDan1/sure.git sure-harness
cd sure-harness
npm.cmd install --ignore-scripts
Copy-Item config/site.example.yaml config/site.local.yaml
# Edit every path and execution surface in config/site.local.yaml.
npm.cmd run sure:site-check
npm.cmd run sure:doctor
$env:PI_OFFLINE = "1"; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pi-test.ps1
```

`config/site.local.yaml` is ignored by Git and must remain local. Advanced deployments can instead set `SURE_SITE_POLICY` to an absolute path outside the repository.

`npm run sure:doctor` reports every prerequisite it can see — Node, uv, Git, `rg`, `fd`, a bash for the agent on Windows, and where the site policy came from. Warnings are safe to start with; `rg` and `fd` only make search faster, and the tools fall back to a built-in scan without them.

Without a local or bundled policy, SURE selects the shipped default at `config/site.default.yaml`, which keeps approved models, promoted results, the runtime cache, datasets, and dataset projections under `~/.sure`. The default relaxes no gate: its approved root starts out empty, only `/sure_approve` publishes into it, and until it holds the model you name, a command that requires site resources still fails closed and points back to this Quick Start and [the site configuration guide](./docs/site-configuration.md).

### Local execution profiles

Docker registry delivery remains the default for local models and is required for VC execution. A self-hosted site that does not need Docker can explicitly permit sealed local Python execution:

```yaml
execution:
  surfaces:
    - local
  local_runtimes:
    - python
```

Then select the Python profile during onboarding and local execution during inference:

```text
/sure_onboard model=<model> package=none
/sure_approve model_dir=/path/to/sure/models/<model>
/sure_approve mode=approve review_manifest=/path/to/review_packet.json decision=approve
/sure_infer model=<approved-model> datasets=<source-path> execution=local
/sure_eval model=<approved-model> datasets=<dataset> metrics=<metric>
```

For keyword spotting, the dataset source declares `task: KWS` plus per-sample
keywords and positive/negative references. Run inference normally, then select
the canonical wake-word route with `metrics=accuracy` or
`metrics=macro_recall`; the resulting metric report includes FAR, FRR, false
alarms per hour, and the DET curve. The current SURE JSON route counts a
sample positive only when `detected` is true and its score reaches the scanned
threshold; complete WekWS-style DET/FAR requires threshold-independent
candidate scores from the model wrapper.

For spoken language identification, declare `task: LID` and expose the model's
language result as `language` or `label`. `/sure_infer` normalizes that result
to the label projection consumed by `sure-evaluation` route
`lid.any.accuracy.lid_label_canonical_v1.classify_v1`; see the
[LID onboarding playbook](./sure/skills/sure_onboard/references/task_playbooks/LID.md).

The two approval calls are intentionally separate: the first creates an immutable candidate and review packet; the second requires an explicit human decision and publishes the verified package. This path currently requires the `uv` backend and a hash-locked requirements file. SURE materializes a content-addressed Model Runtime below the configured `storage.runtime_root`, seals its portable manifest into the approved model bundle, and verifies the runtime plus model-core hashes before inference. A model-local `.venv` or arbitrary host Python is never accepted as an Eval runtime. Omitting `package` keeps the Docker registry default.

## Site Configuration

Configuration sources use this fixed order:

1. Absolute path in `SURE_SITE_POLICY`.
2. Trusted distribution policy at `config/site.bundled.yaml`.
3. Local untracked policy at `config/site.local.yaml`.
4. Shipped default policy at `config/site.default.yaml`, which keeps every root under `~/.sure`.

An explicit invalid `SURE_SITE_POLICY` never falls back to another source. Roots inside a policy are absolute, either POSIX (`/srv/sure`) or Windows drive-letter (`D:\sure`), and may refer to `${HOME}` and `${REPO}`. The complete schema, field semantics, symlink rules, examples, and diagnostics are documented in [docs/site-configuration.md](./docs/site-configuration.md).

Configure `storage.approved_models_roots[0]` once. `/sure_approve` publishes approved packages only to that root, and `/sure_infer model=<name>` resolves the exact child directory from the same root. There is no command-level approval-root override.

For `docker-registry` delivery, the active site policy supplies the registry and repository template. SURE resolves the image destination and version before planning, rather than allowing an agent to invent a namespace; registry credentials remain in the deployment's Docker credential store.

Site policy is independent from the evaluation engine configuration. `/sure_infer` resolves its `config=` parameter first, then `SURE_EVAL_CONFIG`, then the evaluation submodule's `config/default.yaml`. `/sure_eval` rejects an explicit `config=`; it always scores the source bundle as resolved.

## Verify Installation

```bash
npm run sure:site-info
npm run sure:site-check
npm run sure:doctor
npm run check
```

- `sure:site-info` reports the selected source, `site_id`, policy version, path, and SHA256 without printing credentials.
- `sure:site-check` validates the policy contract and storage-boundary relationships. It does not create directories or contact production services.
- `sure:doctor` checks the local harness installation and runtime prerequisites.
- `npm run check` runs repository-wide static checks.

After code changes, follow the [ASR/VAD coding review runbook](./docs/asr-vad-coding-review.md).
It defines the required Feed → Onboard → Approve → Infer → Eval evidence chain.

In PowerShell, call `npm.cmd` instead of `npm` here too, for the execution-policy reason given in the Quick Start.

## Six SURE Commands

| Command | Purpose | Main product |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/sure_feed` | Discover a model and create the onboarding handoff | `sure/handoffs/<model>/model_input.yaml` and evidence |
| `/sure_onboard` | Build and validate a runnable model package | wrapper, model package, and `deployment_ready.json` |
| `/sure_trans` | Transform an existing Dockerfile, model, and inference entrypoint into the standard Eval runtime contract | adapter wrapper, digest-pinned image, and `deployment_ready.json` |
| `/sure_approve` | Audit a completed model package, bind an explicit human decision, and publish it atomically | review packet, approval decision, and `approval_ready.json` |
| `/sure_infer` | Run an approved model over the selected datasets | an inference bundle: predictions, `protocol.yaml`, generation status, and reference projections |
| `/sure_eval` | Score an inference bundle with the evaluation engine, without running the model | an appended `evaluation_runs/<batch>/` with metric artifacts and `eval_run_report.json` |

When a run's turn ends without `sure_finish`, because the model service failed or the session went away, `/sure_resume` picks that run back up from its checkpoint in the same run directory instead of starting over. It takes the most recent resumable run in the project, or `/sure_resume <run-id>` for a specific one.

Model publication is a two-run, human-gated `/sure_approve` workflow; ordinary workflow outputs cannot write into protected roots. Promotion of evaluation results remains a separate human-reviewed operation. Runtime products are otherwise staged in repository-local ignored directories or an explicit `output_dir`.

## Repository Content

Source code, skills, schemas, documentation, and small fixtures belong in Git. Credentials, local policy, model weights, datasets, run state, and generated results do not. See [.gitignore](./.gitignore) and [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

`sure/external/sure-evaluation` is pinned as a Git submodule. See [docs/evaluation_engine.md](./docs/evaluation_engine.md) for the evaluator boundary and route selection model.
